# Database Migration Engine

*A zero-downtime schema migration tool for PostgreSQL*

**Category:** Portfolio Projects

**Problem:** Database migrations are terrifying in production. One wrong
ALTER TABLE can lock a table for minutes and cause outages. Existing
tools don't prevent these pitfalls well enough.

**Solution:** A migration engine that analyzes SQL migrations for
dangerous operations, suggests safe alternatives, simulates impact, and
executes with rollback capability.

**Target User:** Database-focused roles, infrastructure teams, and
backend engineering positions

**Why It Stands Out on GitHub:** This shows deep PostgreSQL internals
knowledge and production engineering maturity. Very few portfolio
projects demonstrate this level of database expertise.

**Skills Demonstrated:** SQL parsing, PostgreSQL internals (locking, DDL
operations), CLI tool design, migration safety patterns, database
operations

**Estimated Build Time:** 3--4 weeks
